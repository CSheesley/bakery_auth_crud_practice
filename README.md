# README
Practice Opportunity for Authorization, Sessions, Routes, & CRUD.

This is a practice Repo built off of what Earl Stephens already created.

Currently, all tests are passing. Depending upon what you would like to work on, you should delete the Baker Model, the Views, and the Controllers (Session & Baker). For best results, delete all three!

To begin, `x` out all tests beside the first one to start on - I would advise to start with the first test on `baker_create_account_login_logout_spec.rb`.

The two tests to work off of are:

  bakery_auth_crud_practice/spec/features/baker_create_account_login_logout_spec.rb
  bakery_auth_crud_practice/spec/features/bakers/show_spec.rb

Good luck!
